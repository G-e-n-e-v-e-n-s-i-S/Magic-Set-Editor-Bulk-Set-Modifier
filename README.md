# Instructions

Download the "Set.Modifier.jar" file from the Releases page (link on the right) and run it by double-clicking on it.

(You must have the Java Runtime Environment installed: https://www.java.com/en/download/)

Specify the path to the Set file.

Define the number of conditions that cards need to meet to be modified.
Only cards satisfying ALL the conditions will be modified.

For example: if you want to modify all the Creatures with Mana Value 5 or more, select 2 conditions.
For the first, select "If the card's TYPE", "contains the following :" and write "Creature".
For the second, select "And if the card's MANA VALUE", "is greater than the following number :" and write "4".

If on the other hand you want to modify all the cards in the Set, select 0 conditions.

Define what modification needs to be applied.

Hit the "Modify Set" button to run the program.

Every time you press the button, the program will make a backup of your Set file before it modifies it.
